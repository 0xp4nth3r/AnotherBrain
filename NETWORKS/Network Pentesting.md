ICMP(Internet Control Message protocol )
is an error-reporting protocol that the network devices such as routers use to generate error message to the source ip.

it is the easiest and fastest method to find the host is up or not

~~~
ping -c 1 199.66.11.4    # 1 echo request to a host
fping -g 199.66.11.0/24  # Send echo requests to ranges
nmap -PEPM -sP -n 199.66.11.0/24 #Send echo, timestamp requests and subnet mask requests
~~~

TCP port discovery 
there are 65535 ports are used it is not easy to scan all ports so we use the masscan to find the open parts this the are mostly used ports

~~~
#Using masscan to scan top20ports of nmap in a /24 range (less than 5min)
masscan -p20,2123,25,53,80,110,111,135,139,143,443,445,993,995,1723,3306,3389,5900,8080 199.66.11.0/24
