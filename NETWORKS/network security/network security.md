firewalls
**Firewalls prevent unauthorized access to networks through software or firmware. By utilizing a set of rules, the firewall examines and blocks incoming and outgoing traffic.**

**A firewall welcomes only those incoming traffic that has been configured to accept. It distinguishes between good and malicious traffic and either allows or blocks specific data packets on pre-established security rules. 

These rules are based on several aspects indicated by the packet data, like their source, destination, content, and so on. They block traffic coming from suspicious sources to prevent cyberattacks. 

For example, the image depicted below shows how a firewall allows good traffic to pass to the user’s private network.

However, in the example below, the firewall blocks malicious traffic from entering the private network, thereby protecting the user’s network from being susceptible to a cyberattack.

This way, a firewall carries out quick assessments to detect malware and other suspicious activities.
