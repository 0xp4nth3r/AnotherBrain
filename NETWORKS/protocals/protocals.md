working of protocals:
The internet and many other data networks work by organizing data into small pieces called packets. Each large data sent between two network devices is divided into smaller packets by the underlying hardware and software. Each network protocol defines the rules for how its data packets must be organized in specific ways according to the protocols the network supports.

protocals classification :
1.  Communication
2.  Management
3.  Security

Communication :
Communication protocols are really important for the functioning of a network. They are so crucial that it is not possible to have computer networks without them. These protocols formally set out the rules and formats through which data is transferred. These protocols handle syntax, semantics, error detection, synchronization, and authentication.

1.HTTP:It is a layer 7 protocol that is designed for transferring a hypertext between two or more systems. HTTP on a client-server model, most of the data sharing over the web is done through using HTTP.
2.TCP: It layouts a reliable stream delivery by using sequenced acknowledgment. It is a connection-oriented protocol i.e., it establishes a connection between applications before sending any data. It is used for communicating over a network. It has many applications such as emails, FTP, streaming media, etc.
