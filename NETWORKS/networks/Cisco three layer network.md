access layer:
The Access layer provides connectivity between end devices (such as computers, IP phones, and printers) and the rest of the network.

Distribution layer:
The Distribution layer aggregates network traffic from the Access layer and provides services such as policy enforcement, routing between VLANs, and quality of service (QoS) implementation.

kore layer:
The Core layer is the backbone of the network and is responsible for high-speed and reliable packet forwarding. Its primary function is to provide fast and efficient transport of data between different network segments.
