Red teams are responsible for simulating real-world attacks on systems, networks, and organizations to identify vulnerabilities, assess defenses, and test the effectiveness of security measures. The specific tasks and activities performed by a red team may vary depending on the scope and objectives of the engagement, but here are some common works done by red teams:

1. Threat Emulation: Red teams aim to emulate the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of real attackers. They perform activities like network scanning, reconnaissance, and targeted attacks to mimic the actions of potential adversaries.

2. Vulnerability Assessment: Red teams identify and exploit vulnerabilities in systems, networks, and applications. They conduct comprehensive vulnerability assessments to uncover weaknesses that could be leveraged by malicious actors.

3. Penetration Testing: Red teams perform penetration testing to assess the security posture of an organization's infrastructure. They attempt to gain unauthorized access to systems, escalate privileges, and move laterally within the network to evaluate the resilience of defenses.

4. Social Engineering: Red teams employ social engineering techniques to exploit human vulnerabilities. This may involve phishing attacks, impersonation, or manipulation tactics to gain unauthorized access or extract sensitive information.

5. Physical Security Assessments: Red teams evaluate physical security measures, such as access controls, surveillance systems, and employee awareness. They attempt to bypass physical barriers and gain unauthorized entry to test the effectiveness of security controls.

6. Red Team Exercises: Red teams conduct comprehensive exercises simulating real-world attack scenarios. These exercises may involve multi-layered attacks, coordinated actions, and advanced persistent threats (APTs) to challenge an organization's defenses.

7. Reporting and Recommendations: After performing their assessments and tests, red teams provide detailed reports outlining the vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and potential impact of their findings. They offer recommendations for improving security controls, enhancing incident response, and mitigating risks.

8. Collaboration and Training: Red teams often collaborate with blue teams (defenders) within an organization to share knowledge, improve incident response capabilities, and enhance overall security posture. They may also provide training sessions and workshops to educate staff on security best practices and raise awareness of emerging threats.

It's important to note that red teams operate within legal and ethical boundaries, and their activities should always be performed with appropriate authorization and consent from the organization being tested.


A firewall is designed to be the main gateway to an organization, with rules to protect internal resources. An attacker may get access to the firewall technology, so we don’t recommend treating it as an “out-of-the-box” solution. An organization should configure a firewall for the specific needs of their business, and keep it up to date through patching and maintenance.

Our pentesters look for configuration errors that could leave a path into the corporate LAN. Pentesters attempt to perform firewall attacks, such as:

- Buffer overflows
- IP spoofing
- Corrupted IP packets
- Attacks against open service
