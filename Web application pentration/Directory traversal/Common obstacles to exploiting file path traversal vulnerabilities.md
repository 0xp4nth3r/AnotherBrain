Nested traversal sequences can be used to bypass some security measures that are designed to detect and prevent directory traversal attacks. These sequences work by including a double dot sequence inside another traversal sequence, such as "../" or "..". For example, a nested traversal sequence might look like "....//" or "..../".


In some contexts, such as in a URL path or the `filename` parameter of a `multipart/form-data` request, web servers may strip any directory traversal sequences before passing your input to the application. You can sometimes bypass this kind of sanitization by URL encoding, or even double URL encoding, the `../` characters, resulting in `%2e%2e%2f` or `%252e%252e%252f` respectively. Various non-standard encodings, such as `..%c0%af` or `..%ef%bc%8f`, may also do the trick.

If an application requires that the user-supplied filename must start with the expected base folder, such as `/var/www/images`, then it might be possible to include the required base folder followed by suitable traversal sequences.
