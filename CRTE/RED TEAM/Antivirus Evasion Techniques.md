**Signature Based** : These kind of antivirus engines are made based on some signatures (patterns created to detect certain sequence of bytes) created to detect what type of code the following executable could have contained. If the code or pattern of bytes is present in _blacklisted content,_ then AV alert is triggered.

**Heuristic Based** : Modern technique of detecting malicious payload by defining some rules and algorithms such that, if the code contains certain set of code / instructions or executable segments, which do certain actions which might prove malicious , then AV alert is triggered.

**Behavior Based** : This technique analyses the behavior of the binary file and categorizes it into malicious and non-malicious. If malicious AV is triggered.
